        <div class="box myPara"><b>1. The Beauty of Modesty in Character</b><br>Modesty is a core value in many cultures and
            religions, including Islam. It’s not just about how one dresses, but also how one speaks, behaves, and
            carries themselves. A modest person shows humility, respect for others, and avoids arrogance. In today’s
            world of self-promotion, modesty remains a timeless virtue that reflects inner strength and dignity.</div>

        <div class="box myPara"><b>2. The Qur’an – A Timeless Guidance</b><br>The Qur’an is the holy book of Islam, revealed
            to
            the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over 23 years. It provides spiritual, moral, social, and legal
            guidance
            for Muslims. Its verses cover everything from the creation of the universe to personal ethics, emphasizing
            mercy, justice, and the importance of seeking knowledge.</div>
        <div class="box myPara"><b>3. Education in Pakistan – Challenges and Hope</b><br>Education in Pakistan faces many
            challenges such as lack of resources, outdated curricula, and inequality between urban and rural areas.
            However, recent years have seen growing awareness and reforms. More NGOs, digital platforms, and government
            initiatives are working to improve access to quality education, especially for girls and underprivileged
            communities.</div>
